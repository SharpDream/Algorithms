## Introduction

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Understanding and implementing algorithms is fundamental to computer science and programming.

This repository is a collection of some of the most common and important algorithms, implemented in various programming languages. Each algorithm comes with a brief description and the code implementation.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient, comparison-based, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: A stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

### Searching

- **Binary Search**: A fast search algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array.
- **Linear Search**: A basic search algorithm that checks each element in the array sequentially.

### Graph Algorithms

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
- **A* Search**: An informed search algorithm used for pathfinding and graph traversal.

### Dynamic Programming

- **Fibonacci Sequence**: An algorithm to generate Fibonacci numbers using dynamic programming.
- **Knapsack Problem**: An algorithm to solve the knapsack problem using dynamic programming.
- **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: An algorithm to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences.

### Others

- **Euclidean Algorithm**: An algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: An algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree for a connected, undirected graph.

## Usage

To use any of the algorithms in this repository, simply clone the repository and navigate to the directory of the algorithm you are interested in. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file or directory, along with a README file explaining how to run the code.
